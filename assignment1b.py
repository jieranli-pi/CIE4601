#2b. (10 points) The data file gives the solar zenith angle Î¸.

#(i.) Compute the annual mean value of SWâ†“TOA and compare its value to the 
#annual mean upward and downward infrared radiative fluxes at the ground surface. 
#Which downward flux is larger?
#(ii.) Calculate the total effect of absorption and reflection of solar radiation 
#by the atmosphere by computing the difference between the downward solar radiative 
#fluxes at the TOA and the observed value at the ground surface.

## 2c.(10 points) (i.)  Make a scatter plot of the observed shortwave radiative  uxes
## at the surfaceas a function of the solar zenith angle.  Choose the size of 
##your dots small enough to enable a distinction between the different measurement 
##points.The maximum values represent conditions with clear (cloud free) skies. 
## The maximum valuesare not falling on a smooth line because the fraction of the 
##solar radiation that is re ected andabsorbed depends on the amounts of aerosols 
##and water vapor, both of which are highly variablein time and space.  Also some 
##patches of thin high clouds may be present.  Let us express theclear sky downward 
##solar radiative  ux at the ground surface asSW#sfc;clr=S0cosexp(=cos)(2)
##(ii.)  Find a best estimate for the clear sky optical depth
##by making a  t by eye.  Add this result,as well as the downward solar radiation 
##received at the top of the atmosphere to your scatter plot.(iii.)  Compute the annual 
##mean value of the downward surface shortwave radiation SW#sfc;clrunder the assumption 
##that at any time clear skies prevail.  With this result we are in a positionto estimate 
##the mean cloud e ect on solar radiation.  To this end compute the di erence betweenthe 
##annual mean values of SW#sfc;clrand the observed downward surface shortwave radiation.
##How large is this cloud radiative forcing e ect for Cabauw?
